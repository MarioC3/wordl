# Wordl\*

This is my take on the famous [Wordle Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), based on [Josh Comeau's Joy of React course](https://www.joyofreact.com/).

This project helped me delve deeper into React concepts such as memoization (useMemo, memo) and data management with context without relying on third-party libraries like zustand or redux.

I understand that applying these concepts to a small project like this may seem unnecessary, but I wanted to push myself and expand my knowledge.

## Acknowledgments

The [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) is the best React course I've taken. Big Shotout to [Josh Comeau](https://x.com/JoshWComeau). His explanations of complex concepts and his breakdown of them are truly impressive. I've been learning a lot, not only from this course but also from his blog posts. He is genuinely one of the üêê in the JS educational space.

Also, this is a purely educational project. I wanted to go beyond Josh's project and explore, tinker, and learn with React APIs. I'm not affiliated with the New York Times Wordle project üòÑ.
